Hi, I am Adrika Chowdhury, from Chattogram, Bangladesh. I am pursuing my Bachelor of Science in Computer Science at the [Asian University for Women](https://asian-university.org/)and expect to graduate in 2025.
As a person, I believe in being friendly, dedicated, hard-working, and enthusiastic. I am also quite efficient in teamwork and organization. During my pastime, I often engage in digital painting, listening to music, or watching series.
After my undergraduate studies, I plan to do my higher studies in my major. After completing my Bachelor’s and Master’s, I set my career goal to secure a high-standard job in the field of Computer Science to get enough important skills needed these days. These skills would be crucial for me to compete in the challenging world.
